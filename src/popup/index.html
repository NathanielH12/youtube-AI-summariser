    <!--Same reason — your CSS is bundled directly into popup.js via style-loader 
    and gets injected as <style> tags automatically when the JS runs.-->

    <!--It's an empty div that React will use as its mounting point — 
    React will inject all the popup UI into this div at runtime. 
    You never put any visible content directly in this HTML file-->

    <!--You'd normally need a <script src="popup.js"> to load your JavaScript. 
        But notice there isn't one here — that's because HtmlWebpackPlugin in 
        your webpack.config.js automatically injects it at build time. 
        When Webpack runs, it generates popup.html in /public with the script 
        tag already added. That's the whole point of that plugin-->
